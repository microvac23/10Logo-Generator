# 10Logo-Generator

## User Story

As a freelance web developer I want to generate a simple logo for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I am prompted for text
then I can enter up to three characters.
<br>When I am prompted for the text color, then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
<br>When I am prompted for a shape, then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
<br>When I am prompted for the shape's color, then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number).
<br>When I have entered input for all the prompts, then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` and the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line.
<br>When I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, then I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered.
